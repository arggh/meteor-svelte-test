# Meteor - Svelte integration test

### How to run?

1. Install Meteor
```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

2. Run Meteor

```
$ meteor
```

3. Open browser at http://localhost:3000



### Notes

- The `svelte:compiler` package has some unfinished changes, so it might print something strange into console on startup, but it works.
- The app uses a beta version of Meteor. Should be ok.
